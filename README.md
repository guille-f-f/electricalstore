# Catalog Control System - Electrical Store

This project is a **catalog control system** for an **electrical store**. The system allows you to manage a catalog of available products for sale without initially handling stock. It was developed using **Spring Boot**.

## Description

The application allows for the registration and querying of items in the product catalog, providing basic information such as item name, description, price, and article number. This system is the first step towards building a more comprehensive system that could, in the future, include stock management, dynamic pricing, and other inventory-related features.

## Features

- Registration and management of items in the catalog.
- Each item has a unique identifier, name, description, and article number.
- Simple implementation, based on **Spring Boot**.
- Utilizes **JPA** and **Hibernate** for database management.

## Requirements

- **Java 11** or higher.
- **Maven** or **Gradle** (Maven is preferred for this project).
- **Database**: The project is set to use an in-memory **H2** database by default (this can be switched to other databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL in the future).
